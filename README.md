# cloud-resume-challenge

This project is my attempt of building an online resume, simply a static web page, serving my
resume html and css written from scratch by myself, since I wanted to keep it as simple as 
could be.

The complex work is setting up the infrastructure needed to serve the page, and have it 
use https: and be a secure site.  The cert process was a big learning step for me.

I use "aws-vault" to store and call my aws-cli and Terraform commands, so credentials 
are secure on local computer for now.
